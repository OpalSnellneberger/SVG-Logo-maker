# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js command-line application designed to generate simple logos for projects. It allows users to specify text, colors, and shapes, and then creates an SVG file based on their input.

## Walkthrough

### Running the Application
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your SVG Logo Maker application is located.
cd path/to/svg-logo-maker
3. Install libraries
npm i
4. Run the application using the following command:
node index.js

### Providing Input
When prompted, enter up to three characters for the text of your logo. For example, you could enter "ABC" or "XYZ".

Next, enter the text color. You can specify a color keyword (e.g., "red", "blue", "green") or a hexadecimal color code (e.g., "#FF0000", "#00FF00", "#0000FF"). If you're unsure, you can simply press Enter to use the default color, which is black.

Now, choose a shape for your logo. You'll be presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square. Type the name of the shape you want to use (e.g., "circle") and press Enter.

After selecting a shape, you'll be prompted to enter the color for the shape. Like before, you can enter a color keyword or a hexadecimal color code. Press Enter to use the default color, which is white.

### Generating the Logo
Once you've entered input for all the prompts, the application will generate an SVG file named logo.svg in the current directory. You'll see a message in the command line confirming that the logo has been generated.

### Viewing the Logo
You can now open the logo.svg file in a web browser to view your generated logo. The browser should display a 300x200 pixel image that matches the text, shape, and colors you specified.
